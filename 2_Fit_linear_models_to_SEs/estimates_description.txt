ESTIMATES_DESCRIPTION

Running the R-file analysis.R in this folder will create the file estimates.RData in this folder.
We here describe the data objects that are contained in the file estimates.RData.
There are several arrays in the data file. To understand the structure (i.e., the dimensions) of each array, you may run the following lines in R:
dim(array)
dimnames(array)

# ARRAY: bias
the difference between each estimate from an occupancy model and the true value

# ARRAY: biasmedian
median across the bias for each combination of parameter value and scenario

# ARRAY: esti
the 'cleaned' estimates from fitting occupancy models to the simulated data (all non-valid estimates have been replaced with NA in this array)

# ARRAY: estimean
means across all valid estimates (=esti) for each combination of parameter value and scenario

# ARRAY: lmerSE
the estimates from fitting the linear regression models to the standard errors of the occupancy estimates

# VECTOR: pvals
the different levels of occupancy probability psi and detection probability p that were used to simulate the data: a scale with intervals of 0.02 that goes from 0.1 to 0.9 (with a total length of 41)

# VECTOR: S
the different levels of Number of single-visit sites: 0, 150, 500, 1000, 5000

# NUMERIC: simrep
the number of simulation replicates that were run for each parameter combination: 1000

# ARRAY: validity
the proportions of valid estimates for each combination of parameter value and scenario in relation to the number that was simulated (i.e., 1000)
